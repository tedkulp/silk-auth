* Authentication for Silk *

I need a description.

** To Use **

Put this into your silk project's extensions directory
(__extenions/silk-auth__). Then do some other stuff which I'll explain
later after we get it totally fixed up and put in some tests.

** TODO **

	* Add Datamapper fields
	* Add tests
